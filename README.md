# Handling and Analyzing Vector and Raster Data Cubes with R

Tutorial for the [OpenGeoHub 2020 summer school](https://opengeohub.org/summer_school_2020)

Summary: vector and raster data cubes include vector and raster
data as special cases, but extend this to vector time series, OD
matrices, multi-band raster data, multi-band raster time series,
multi-attribute vector or raster time series, and more general
to array data where one ore more dimensions are associated with
space and/or with time. Examples come from pretty much all areas
dealing with spatiotemporal data. This tutorial will go through a
large number of examples to illustrate this idea, mostly focusing
on the packages `stars` and `sf` and those supporting their classes
(like tmap, mapview, gstat, ggplot2).
